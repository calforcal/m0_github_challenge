# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

1. First you must make a directory and corresponding files, then initialize it using `git init` in terminal
2. then `git add <file name>` in the terminal
3. Use `git commit -m "initial commit"` to make your initial repository commit.
4. Go to GitHub repositories, make a new repository using the same name as your directory to avoid confusion.
5. Follow the instructions in github for pushing a local (existing) repository to the cloud.
